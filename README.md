# Online Programming Pin Board

This project was made for the OOP class at my University and it's theme is a programming Pin Board.
<br><br>

## Description & Functionality
The main idea of the project works as follows: users can post on the site and annotate the post with tags and categories, while the users can get recommended posts, interact with them, etc.

As of now this project features 2 main classes, as well as 2 manager classes alongside them.
These 2 classes are: "Post" and "User". <br>

The User class contains a username, age, interests and skills while the Post class contains a text, date posted, categories and tags.
The interests of users are the categories of posts and the skills of users are the tags of posts. <br>

With this in mind, you can do things like recommend a type of post to a type of user for example. <br>

This project has the basic logic implemented (getters, setters) as well as some more complex logic (managers, factory method) and features some methods that allows to search by username, get recommended posts, etc.
